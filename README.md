# COCO-Annotation-Mask-Generator
Python script generates colored masks from COCO-style annotations. It reads the COCO annotation files, creates masks for each annotation, colors the masks based on the annotation's category, and saves the colored masks as images. The script is designed to handle multiple categories and can be easily extended to support more categories if needed.

Features:
Supports multiple categories with different colors for each category.
Processes images in parallel using multiple workers to speed up the mask generation.
Handles errors gracefully and skips over images or annotations that cause problems.
Outputs colored masks as PNG images.
Usage:
To run this script, you need to provide three positional arguments: coco_dir, image_dir, and output_dir. Additionally, you can provide an optional argument --num-workers to specify the number of parallel workers for processing images.

Here is an example of how to run this script from the command line:
python3 mask_generator.py /path/to/coco_dir /path/to/image_dir /path/to/output_dir --num-workers 4

Replace mask_generator.py with the name of your Python script, and replace /path/to/coco_dir, /path/to/image_dir, and /path/to/output_dir with the actual paths to your COCO annotations directory, image directory, and output directory, respectively. The --num-workers 4 part is optional and specifies that 4 workers should be used for parallel processing. If you don't provide this argument, the script will use 4 workers by default.

Requirements:
Python 3
OpenCV
NumPy
pycocotools
You can install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install opencv-python numpy pycocotools

Limitations:
This script assumes that the COCO annotations are correct and complete. If there are errors or missing data in the annotations, the script may not generate the masks correctly.
