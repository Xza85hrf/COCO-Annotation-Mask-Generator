# COCO-Annotation-Mask-Generator
Python script generates colored masks from COCO-style annotations. It reads the COCO annotation files, creates masks for each annotation, colors the masks based on the annotation's category, and saves the colored masks as images. The script is designed to handle multiple categories and can be easily extended to support more categories if needed.
